# Weihnachtsgruss (Computer)

This is probably the oldest preserved piece of software that I've ever written. 
It's called "Weihnachtsgruss" (Christmas greeting) and I guess the Christmas it refers to could be that of 1988, when I was 5 years old.

It's a BASIC program for an Atari 600 XL (or maybe even an 800 XL) that I've found in my cassette tape collection.

I've attached a high quality WAV file as well as conversions to CAS and "raw" format (by a8cas) and the original source code (converted from the `.raw` using [https://github.com/mistalro/atariconv](mistalro/atariconv)). 
Oh, and also a photograph of the tape that it was stored on. 
A 90 minute tape containing about 18 seconds of audio.

The code doesn't do much, but I'm so happy that I've found it and that I was even able to restore it.
